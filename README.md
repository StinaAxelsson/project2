# Project Description
Be ready for a little adventure in the outer space, in this small web-browser game!
First you have to chose a spaceship to travel in, and then you are ready to play. 
If you play this game on a desktop, you move the player with the arrow keys RIGHT and LEFT. And if you are playing it on a touchdevice, you move the player on the touch screen, just press on the screen where you want to move, or drag it right and left.
It falls down comets and money-bags from the top and you have to be careful not to hit any of the comets! But if you hit the moneybag you collect score. It is a game you can play to take your personal record and challange a friend to try beat your score. Good luck!

This project is developed as my second Portfolio Project assignment during my course at Code Institute.
It is created with HTML for the structure, CSS for all the styling and then JavaScript to make it a interactive frontend site.

# UX

## User goals
As a first time and a returning visitor am I looking for...
  * a great way to pass some time.
  * to visit this site and feel satisfied with the way it is structured.
  * a site that I can use on my phone, laptop or PC and it works and look good.
  * somewhere to allow users to visit the developers social media.

## User Stories
<b>As a user I want a site that...</b>
 1. ...is easy to navigate throug.
 2. ... is fully responsive so I can visit it and use it on every device.
 3. ... I know what to do and what it is about.
 4. ... have nice colors and font-sizes so it is easy to see and read.
 5. ... I understand what to do even if I never visit it before.
## Site owner goals
1. Have a nice and tidy website that is easy to see what to do.
2. Have a great colors theme throug the website that fits the purpose with the site.
3. Have a fully responsive site that works great on every different screen sizes.
4. Make it easy to navigate throug the website.
5. Have some sort of contact information in the site like social-links to the developer if they have any questions or want to know more.
## Design choises
This site is about a space adventure, and therefore I wanted it to be colorful and an invitation to something fun but also obvious what it is about. I chose the background image and the images on the spaceships in a similar cartooney theme to match.
## Colours
For the colours I going with the colors of the galaxy, that is purple, blue, pink and black. To clarify that this is a game about the space. And the colours matching very good and is great to use togehter.

## Typography
For the text i chose to go with two Fonts. For the headlines, rubrics and buttons I used 'Tourney', it is a fun and great font and make it look more like a game. And for the score and instructions I used 'Roboto', because it is a great font for reading and it goes well with Tourney.

## Structure
<b>This is a simple browser game with no scroll on the pages. With the basic structure of:</b>

- Header
  * On the top with the title, fully responsive and give all the information that needed. 

- Body 
  * Contains the gamespace, buttons to navigate, intructions, the game itself and a hamburger icon for the sidebar menu.

- Footer
  * Information of the developer and icons with links to the owners social media.



# Wireframes
Here is my wireframes.
I have change the game title during the time of this project. But otherwise I have stick this model as much as I could, some of the features have I not implement because of the time limit and my reduced knowledge of javascript.

* [Mobile](https://github.com/StinaAxelsson/spacerace-project2/blob/main/wireframes/mobile%20-%20all.pdf)

# Features
Here I explain my chose of design and structure on the website and all of the features. With screenshots to see what I describe. 
## Existing Features
 * <b>Header and Navigation</b>
   * The title of the game is placed centred on the website and is in the same size on every page.
   * The navigation is a small box in the left corner with the hamburger icon and appear when you are on antoher page then the start/index page.
   * On the start page, the user navigate forward with the two buttons with two choises, to read the instructions or just start the game.
   * sidebar opens when the user press the hamburger icon, and contains a menu with all of the pages.

![alt text](https://github.com/StinaAxelsson/spacerace-project2/blob/main/wireframes/navbutton.png)
  * <b>Menu container</b>
    * This feature is the container that holds the buttons on the start page and the information from the "how to play" page and the "Start Game" page. 
    ![alt text](https://github.com/StinaAxelsson/spacerace-project2/blob/main/wireframes/startgame.png)
  * <b>Buttons</b>
    * All of the buttons have the same colour theme and fonts. The startpage have two big buttons that will get the user to the game istructions or to choose a player.
    * On both "how to play" and "Start Game" pages there is a "back" button.
    ![alt text](https://github.com/StinaAxelsson/spacerace-project2/blob/main/wireframes/startgame.png) FIX
  * <b>Instructions</b>
    * This page is a short text with information of how to get startet with the game and how it works.
    ![alt text](https://github.com/StinaAxelsson/spacerace-project2/blob/main/wireframes/howto.png)
  * <b>Choose Spaceship</b>
    * On the "Star game" page, you will first choose witch spaceship you want to play as in the game later on. There is three images of different spaceships. I have chose spaceships that people tend to know about. As the "Millennuim-Falcon" from Star Wars and also the "USS-Discovery", and the third one called Rebellian Ship. So the user can choose it favorit ship.
    * The images is buttons, so when a user is clicking on one of them, it takes them to the game and it will start automatically.
      ![alt text](https://github.com/StinaAxelsson/spacerace-project2/blob/main/wireframes/back.png)
  * <b>Game board box</b>
    * This page contain the game and here is where the user interact with the site. The game starts automatically and the user control the spaceship with the keyboard arrow left or right on a desktop/PC, and move it on the screen on a touch device. 
    * Score is increase when the spaceship hit a moneybag.
    * Game over if the spaceship hit a comet that is falling down from top of the gameboard box.
    * A "play again" button is shown in the gameover box when the game is over, to restart.

    ![alt text](https://github.com/StinaAxelsson/spacerace-project2/blob/main/wireframes/gameover.png)
  * <b>Footer and Social media links</b>
    * In the footer, there is a small paragraph with a sign of who has developed the game and site.
    * Underneath the paragraph, there is icons with links that opens up in a new tablet and take the user to the developeres social media.
    ![alt text](https://github.com/StinaAxelsson/spacerace-project2/blob/main/wireframes/footer.png)


## Features Left to Implement
* In future I will implement different difficulty. Starting easy, and when you have got 10 score, the comets fall down a little bit faster, and when you hit 25 in score it falls down even faster, and so on so it gived the user a little more challange.
* I wanted to implement a high score table, so you can save your score every time.
* Similar to the high score table, I wanted to implement a high score list of the total top three players araound the world and not only your own score.

# Testing
I used Chrome Devtools to test that my code was working. With JavaScript I used the console.log which helped me find errors and see if I typed my code correctly, that was not yet visible on the website itself.
Also Devtools was very helpful when I needed to make my site responsive.

When I had deployed my site, I could try the live link on my phone to see how it worked and looked like. 
My boyfriend, sisters and my mum have helped me find bugs and what I could do to further improve the user experience. 
It has been tested live on a <b>IphoneX, Iphone 12, Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra and a Samusung A5. Also on my laptop with the screensize 15" and a screensize 24".</b>
To see how it looks in smaller screens and other sizes, I used Devtools responsive so see how it worked. 
## Bugs
My biggest problem that caused a lot of errors and bugs and what I did to fix it. 
* <b>Control movement</b>: I had a lot of trouble trying to make a functional code for the movement of the spaceship so that it worked well for touch screens and PCs. First I tryed to make buttons for touch screens and I could not make a good code without using the canvas elements in the HTML instead. And because I made a game without the canvas I finally found a helpful page on internet that only used touchEvents. That made it easy for users to use touch directly on the gameboard instead to control the spacdeship, which I think is both easier and more user-friendly than right and left touch buttons.
* <b>Collision Detection function:</b> This part of my code took me 2 days to find out how to implement. I had hugh problem to get the logic of how to make the comets collide with the player. I tried everything that I could find on the internet and youtube. But nothing would work. I got help from the tutors from code institute and together with them I finally got the logic of the code to make it work and could implement that collision in my script and it worked perfectly. That was a special moment for my personal development in writing JavaScript. I also used that to detect collision for the moneybags but instead of make the game stop, I increase the score and removed the moneybags when they where collected.
* <b>Responsiv gameboard:</b> Even if the game worked fine in Devtools at the responsive IphoneX, it did not work in real with the live link when my mother and sister tried it on their IphoneX phone. They could not see the whole screen and could not scroll down when they where on the page with the game in action. So I am thankful for their help because otherwise I probably would not have discovered this bug. I was able to fix this by deleting "height: 100vh;" under body tag in the CSS code. In this way it was possible to scroll and see the whole page as you should.

# Deployment
This project was developed using the Gitpod IDE. In order to save my work I always add commit messenges that describe what I have done and then Git push in the console to save and push it from Gitpod to Github.

For deploy this site I had to follow this steps:

1. Log in to my account at Github.
2. Open the repository that I wanted to deploy.
3. Select settings in the menu at the top and scroll down to Pages.
4. Open the drop-down menu in the source section.
5. Select main instead of none.
6. Save and wait a few seconds until it deployed.
7. Copy the link and open it in you browser to see the live link.

Here is my deployed live link: https://stinaaxelsson.github.io/spacerace-project2/
