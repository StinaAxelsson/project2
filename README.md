# SPACE RACE
# Project Description
Be ready for a little adventure in the outer space, in this small web-browser game!
First you have to chose a spaceship to travel in, and then you are ready to play. 
If you play this game on a desktop, you move the player with the arrow keys RIGHT and LEFT. And if you are playing it on a touchdevice, you move the player on the touch screen, just press on the screen where you want to move, or drag it right and left.
It falls down comets and money-bags from the top and you have to be careful not to hit any of the comets! But if you hit the moneybag you collect score. It is a game you can play to take your personal record and challange a friend to try beat your score. Good luck!

This project is developed as my second Portfolio Project assignment during my course at Code Institute.
