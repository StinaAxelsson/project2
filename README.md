# SPACE RACE
# Project Description
Be ready for a little adventure in the outer space, in this small web-browser game!
First you have to chose a spaceship to travel in, and then you are ready to play. 
If you play this game on a desktop, you move the player with the arrow keys RIGHT and LEFT. And if you are playing it on a touchdevice, you move the player on the touch screen, just press on the screen where you want to move, or drag it right and left.
It falls down comets and money-bags from the top and you have to be careful not to hit any of the comets! But if you hit the moneybag you collect score. It is a game you can play to take your personal record and challange a friend to try beat your score. Good luck!

This project is developed as my second Portfolio Project assignment during my course at Code Institute.
It is created with HTML for the structure, CSS for all the styling and then JavaScript to make it a interactive frontend site.

## Design choises
This site is about a space adventure, and therefore I wanted it to be colorful and an invitation to something fun but also obvious what it is about. I chose the background image and the images on the spaceships in a similar cartooney theme to match.
## Colours
For the colours I going with the colors of the galaxy, that is purple, blue, pink and black. To clarify that this is a game about the space. And the colours matching very good and is great to use togehter.
## Typography
For the text i chose to go with two Fonts. For the headlines, rubrics and buttons I used 'Tourney', it is a fun and great font and make it look more like a game. And for the score and instructions I used 'Roboto', because it is a great font for reading and it goes well with Tourney.

   * The title of the game is placed centred on the website and is in the same size on every page.
   * The navigation is a small box in the left corner with the hamburger icon and appear when you are on antoher page then the start/index page.
   * On the start page, the user navigate forward with the two buttons with two choises, to read the instructions or just start the game.

  * <b>Menu container</b>
    * This feature is the container that holds the buttons on the start page and the information from the "how to play" page and the "Start Game" page. 
  * <b>Buttons</b>
    * All of the buttons have the same colour theme and fonts. The startpage have two big buttons that will get the user to the game istructions or to choose a player.
    * On both "how to play" and "Start Game" pages there is a "back" button.
  * <b>Choose Spaceship</b>
    * On the "Star game" page, you will first choose witch spaceship you want to play as in the game later on. There is three images of different spaceships. I have chose spaceships that people tend to know about. As the "Millennuim-Falcon" from Star Wars and also the "USS-Discovery", and the third one called Rebellian Ship. So the user can choose it favorit ship.
    * The images is buttons, so when a user is clicking on one of them, it takes them to the game and it will start automatically.
