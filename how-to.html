            Welcome to a adventure in outer space. <br>
            First you will have to choose what spaceship to travel in. <br>
            When you have chosen the shapeship the game will start. <br>
            If you playing on a desktop, you move the spaceship with RIGHT and LEFT arrows.
            <br>
            If you playing on any touch device you just point the spacehip on the screen with you finger. <br>
            You have to pick up all the moneybags that flying around in the space to gain points. But watch out for the falling comets that coming towards you! <br>
            Good luck!
